# Deep and Generative Games Managed by GPT-4

This project is heavily inspired by the paper [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03374) but strives to go beyond the original paper in several ways:
1. The original paper focuses on AI managed agents to control a game character in the world. This project aims to also include the game world itself as a managed agent by various means:
   - On-the-fly creation of new game objects including their finite-state machines and pixel art
   - 100% free interaction with the game world by letting agents map the users intent (natural language) to the game objects
2. Easy integration of all agents into any game engine or programming language. This is done by strictly inputting and outputting JSON-Objects to and from the agents.
3. **YOU** can be a part in this world with your own character.
4. **MULTIPLAYER** with PwPwA (Player with Player with Agent, and yes the Bad pun ist intedend and with because collaboration and so on).

This is a huge project and I am currently working on the first steps to make this a reality. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to **[COLLABORATE](/CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

## Agent preparation and ideas for GPT-4, DALL-E or others

The initial concepts and discoveries for various autonomous agents are documented in the [agent_concepts](/agent_concepts) folder.
This is a work in progress and will be updated as we discover more about the agents or create new ones.
