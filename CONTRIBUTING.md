## Steps to contribute

Unfortunately since this project almost entirely relies on (Chat)GPT and other OpenAI Tools you should setup an account and API Token so you can [use the OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).
**USAGE OF THIS API COSTS MONEY!** I suggest to setup resonable [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits) this project tryies to minimze the costs as much as possible though 
Also if you don't have access to the GPT-4 model via the API yet (this is separate from ChatGPT Plus) then I suggest using ChatGPT Plus manually instead.
